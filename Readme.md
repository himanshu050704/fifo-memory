FIFO Verification Environment â€“ Designed and implemented a SystemVerilog/UVM-based verification setup for a FIFO module, covering all functional scenarios including overflow, underflow, and simultaneous read/write. Developed reusable testbench components (driver, monitor, scoreboard) with assertions for protocol compliance, applied constrained-random and directed testing, and achieved comprehensive functional and code coverage to ensure design robustness.
